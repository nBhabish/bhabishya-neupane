### Where does most reviews come from?

```{r}
chocolate %>% 
  add_count(company_location) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  filter(n >= 50) %>% 
  count(company_location, sort = T) %>%

  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1200), breaks = seq(0, 1200, by = 200))+
  labs(title = "Top 8 Frequently Reviewed Chocolate Manufacturing Countries",
       subtitle = "The review was conducted by The Manhattan Chocolate Society",
       caption   = "Data Source: The Manhattan Chocolate Society")+
  theme(text = element_text(family = "BenchNine"),
        legend.position = "none",
        plot.title = element_text(size = 20))
```


### Commonly Used Ingredients in Chocolate Manufacturing Companies Across the World
```{r out.height="150%"}
chocolate %>%
  mutate(company_location = company_location %>% fct_lump(10)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(ingredients)) %>%
  add_count(ingredients) %>%
  filter(n > 200) %>%  # keeping ingredients that occur more than 100 times in the dataset
  select(-n) %>%
  group_by(company_location) %>%
  add_count(ingredients) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    company_location = company_location %>% fct_relevel(
      c(
        "U.S.A.",
        "Other",
        "Canada",
        "France",
        "U.K.",
        "Italy",
        "Belgium",
        "Ecuador",
        "Australia",
        "Switzerland",
        "Germany"
      )
    ),
    company_location = company_location %>% fct_reorder(n, .fun = sum)
  ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, company_location, fill = ingredients)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge", width = 0.5) +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "BenchNine"),
    legend.position = "top",
    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = "bold")
  ) +
  scale_fill_paletteer_d("nationalparkcolors::SmokyMountains") +
  labs(y = "",
       x = "Frequency",
       fill = "Ingredients",
       title = "Frequently Used Ingredients in Chocolate Manufacturing Companies around the World",
       subtitle = "B stands for Beans, S stands for Sugar, C stands for Cocoa Butter, and L stands for Lecithin", 
       caption = "Data Source: The Manhattan Chocolate Society")
```


### Ten most frequently reviewed companies in the United States 

```{r}
chocolate %>% 
  filter(company_location == "U.S.A.") %>% 
  add_count(company_manufacturer) %>% 
  filter(n >= 15) %>% 
  count(company_manufacturer, sort = T) %>% 
  mutate(company_manufacturer = company_manufacturer %>% fct_reorder(n)) %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(n, company_manufacturer))+
  geom_col(fill = "#769370")+
  labs(x = "", 
       y = "", 
       title = "Top 10 Frequently Reviewed Chocolate Manufacturing Companies in the United States", 
       caption = "Data Source: The Manhattan Chocolate Society")+
  theme(text = element_text(family = "BenchNine"),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 12.5))
```


### Cocoa Percent Distribution

#### In the United States

```{r}
chocolate %>% 
  filter(company_location == "U.S.A.") %>% 
  mutate(cocoa_percent = parse_number(cocoa_percent)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(cocoa_percent))+
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "#769370")+
  expand_limits(x = 50)+
  labs(y = "# of Chocolate Manufacturing Companies", 
       x = "Cocoa Percent",
       title = "Cocoa Percent Distribution Histogram | U.S.A.",
       caption = "Data Source: The Manhattan Chocolate Society")+
  theme(text = element_text(family = "BenchNine"),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 20))+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1/1))
```

From the above plot, it does look like most of the companies reviewed by The Manhattan Chocolate Society had cocoa in their products between 70% to 75%. 

#### Across the World

```{r}
chocolate %>% 
  mutate(cocoa_percent = parse_number(cocoa_percent)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(cocoa_percent))+
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "#769370")+
  expand_limits(x = 40)+
  labs(y = "# of Chocolate Manufacturing Companies", 
       x = "Cocoa Percent",
       title = "Cocoa Percent Distribution Histogram | Globally", 
       caption = "Data Source: The Manhattan Chocolate Society")+
  theme(text = element_text(family = "BenchNine"),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 20))+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1/1))
```


### Word Used to Describe the Chocolate in the USA


```{r}
chocolate %>%
  filter(company_location == "U.S.A.") %>%
  add_count(first_memorable_characteristics) %>%
  filter(n > 28) %>%
  mutate(first_memorable_characteristics = glue("{first_memorable_characteristics} ({n})"), 
         first_memorable_characteristics = first_memorable_characteristics %>% fct_reorder(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(rating, first_memorable_characteristics, fill = first_memorable_characteristics)
  ) +
  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.9) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_paletteer_d("nationalparkcolors::GeneralGrant")+
  theme(text = element_text(family = "BenchNine"), 
        plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = "bold"))+
  labs(y = "First Memorable Characteristic of the Chocolate", 
       x = "Rating", 
       title = "Distribution of Chocolate's First Memorable Characteristics in the USA", 
       caption = "Data Source: The Manhattan Chocolate Society")
```

```{r}
freq_reviewed_4_us_companies <- chocolate %>% 
  filter(company_location == "U.S.A.") %>% 
  count(company_manufacturer, sort = T) %>% 
  slice(1:4)

freq_reviewed_4_us_companies %>% 
  reactable::reactable()
```

```{r}
chocolate %>% 
  filter(company_location == "U.S.A.", 
         company_manufacturer %in% (freq_reviewed_4_us_companies %>% pull(company_manufacturer))) %>% 
  mutate(first_memorable_characteristics = first_memorable_characteristics %>% fct_lump(4)) %>% 
  count(company_manufacturer, first_memorable_characteristics, sort = T) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(first_memorable_characteristics, n))+
  geom_col(fill = "#769370")+
  facet_wrap(~company_manufacturer, scales = "free_y")+
  theme(text = element_text(family = "BenchNine"),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 12.5))+
  labs(x = "Memorable Characteristics", y = "", 
       title = "Words used to describe the highly reviewed chocolate companies in the United States",
       caption = "Data Source: The Manhattan Chocolate Society")
```

The plot isn't super informative, but Guittard products were described as "creamy" and "sweet" more often than not. 

```{r}
chocolate %>% 
  mutate(most_memorable_characteristics = str_split(most_memorable_characteristics, pattern = ", |,")) %>% 
  unnest_wider(most_memorable_characteristics) %>% 
  reactable::reactable()
```
