  Hi there! Welcome.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I'm a senior at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln double majoring in Mathematics and Economics. I specialize in using R for data analysis, economic research, and data visualization. I am very passionate about knowledge sharing / dissemination and picking up (and putting down) multitude of side projects. Check out some of my works under blog tab. 

I am originally from Dharan, Nepal. :nepal:

P.S. My first name is pronounced VA-VISH-YUH (three syllables)
