intro: |
  I have been watching Formula 1: Drive to Survive, Netflix originals, and have learned a lot about F1 and how it is such a unique sport. I am looking forward to doing some data analysis and machine learning projects revolving around F1. Apart from that, I am teaching myself {tidymodels} on nights and weekends. I am also brushing up on my Python from Miles Chen's lecture on YouTube and Machine Learning concepts from Cynthia Rudin's lecture on YouTube.
