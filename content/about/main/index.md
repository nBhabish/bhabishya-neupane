intro: | 
  Raised in Dharan, Nepal by two teachers, I am now an aspiring data scientist familiar with cloud platform like AWS and an R user for more than 3 years. I enjoy creating meaningful applications and visualizations using real world data and extracting interesting insights. 

  I am also a massive football (or, shall I say "soccer") enthusiast. I have been a Manchester United fan for more than 15 years. I know we're not doing great at the moment, but we will be back to winning trophies soon. 
  
  Currently, I am residing in Lincoln, NE and actively seeking Data Science opportunities. Please feel free to reach out if you find my works interesting.
