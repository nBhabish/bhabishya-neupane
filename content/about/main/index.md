  I have been watching Formula 1: Drive to Survive, a Netflix originals, and have learned a lot about F1 and how it is such a unique sport. Hopefully, I can do some data analysis and machine learning projects revolving around F1. Apart from that, I am spending most of my time cheering for England in the Euros.
