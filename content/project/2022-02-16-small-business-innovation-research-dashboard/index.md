### About the Project


The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programs is a competitive program that encourages small businesses to engage in Federal Research/Research and Development (R/R&D) with the potential for commercialization. Through a competitive awards-based program, SBIR awards enable small businesses to explore their technological potential and provide the incentive to profit from its commercialization.

This project was inspired by the Bureau of Business Research @ UNL.
