### About the Project

```toml
Please click the link above to view the application
```

The application utilizes XGBoost algorithm behind the scenes to predict the price of new bikes as the user plays around with features like Bike Family, Bike Type, and Frame Material in the application.

It also enables user to change the name of the bike and see how they are priced based on different features.

Instance:

- Go to the application and enter "F-Si AL 1" in the Bike Model text input box and click apply, and see how the application predicts price for the new bike of your choice.
