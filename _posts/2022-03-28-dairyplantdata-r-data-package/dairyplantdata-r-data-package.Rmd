# About the Project

The purpose behind building `{dairyplantdata}` data package was to facilitate senior economists at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln to investigate the [Economic Impact of Dairy Processing Expansion in Nebraska](https://farm.unl.edu/documents/dairy/economic-impact-dairy-processing-expansion-may-3-2021.pdf). It was also built to remove the hassle of searching datasets in some corner of our computer. 

I personally did not want to go through multiple folders searching for a dataset, so I was more motivated to build this into a data package.
