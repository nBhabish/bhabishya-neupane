# About the Project

This shiny dashboard was put together in a very short notice. I worked on this project two weeks before my graduation and there were a lot of changes that were made on this dashboard. 

### About SBIR
The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) programs is a competitive program that encourages small businesses to engage in Federal Research/Research and Development (R/R&D) with the potential for commercialization. Through a competitive awards-based program, SBIR awards enable small businesses to explore their technological potential and provide the incentive to profit from its commercialization.
